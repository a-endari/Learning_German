# writer mode - Day One

## practicing both writing and Typing at the same timeðŸ˜‰

In the name of God, not the God you all belive it, but the intelligent being that on purpose or randomly is the cause of all this mayham we call universe.

Now the clock shows 10:58 p.m

Anita is upstairs
and I am here writing. 
so what is the point of all this I have no idea.
Or maybe I have some idea! I am trying to improve both my typing skills and my English at the same time, it is all about the speed at which we type!
the faster you learn to type, the better your ability to focus on what you are typing gets!
